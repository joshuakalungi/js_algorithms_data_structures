// Template literals support multiline strings without the need for escape characters:

const multilineString = `
  This is a multiline string.
  It can span multiple lines without the need for \\n.
`;

console.log(multilineString);
// Output:
//   This is a multiline string.
//   It can span multiple lines without the need for \n.
